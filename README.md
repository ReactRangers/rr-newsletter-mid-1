## React Rangers Newsletter Middle #1

*This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). See
[the official guide](GUIDE.md) to learn more about this tool.*

Welcome to another one in the series of React tasks that we send periodically to the subscribers
of [our official newsletter](http://eepurl.com/dyF8I9)! If you'd also like to challenge your React
programming skills and get professional code review, we'll be very happy to see you
[sign up](http://eepurl.com/dyF8I9)!

### Running

Make sure you run `npm install` first to install the dependencies.

[npm start](GUIDE.md#npm-start)

### The task

The [App](src/App.js) component has three buttons. Each of these buttons is supposed to trigger a standard JS alert box with the application name available in props. Currently, only the first button
has some implementation, but it does not work. Your task is to fix this implementation and also come
up with two other solutions for correct binding of `this` in the event handler for the other buttons.
Please also add a comment in code explaining which of those methods is your favorite and why.

Submission deadline for code review: July 4th, 2018.
